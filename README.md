# personal_projects
I've developed an interest for Data Science and Machine Learning and began studying these subjects more in depth since December 2020. This is my first repository on Github 
and my first experience sharing my personal projects online. I hope to learn a lot from this community and develop as a professional. If you have any tips on interesting topics
to engage on, good educational platforms/books about DS and ML and ways to approach and solve problems on these subjects, please contact me, it will be much appreciated! :)

The first project posted here is still a work in progress.
